<h2>A sample program to test the chained payments</h2>

<h3 class="row">Chained Payments</h3>
<div class ="row">
<p class="eight columns centered">A chained payment is a payment from a sender that is indirectly split among multiple 
receivers. It is an extension of a typical payment from a sender to a receiver, 
in which a receiver, known as the primary receiver, passes part of the payment to 
other receivers, who are called secondary receivers.

    <p class="eight columns centered">
        You can have at most one primary receiver and 1-5 secondary receivers. 
        Chained payments are useful in cases when the primary receiver acts as 
        an agent for other receivers. The sender deals only with the primary 
        receiver and does not know about the secondary receivers, including how 
        a payment is split among receivers. The following example shows a sender 
        making a payment of $100:

<div class="row">
    <p class="eight columns centered">
        In this example, the primary receiver receives $100 from the senderâ€™s 
        perspective. The primary receiver actually receives only $10 and passes 
        a total of $90 to secondary receivers, Receiver 2 and Receiver 3.

<h3 class="row">Delayed Chained Payments</h3>
<div class ="row">
<p class="eight columns centered">
    By default, payments to all receivers in a chained payment are immediate. 
    However, you can choose to delay a payment to a secondary receiver. For 
    example, as primary receiver, you may require secondary receivers to perform 
    some action, such as shipping goods or waiting for expiration of a return 
    period, before making payment. To complete the payment, you must explicitly 
    execute a payment to secondary receivers after the sender pays you. The 
    payment must occur within 90 days, after which you cannot complete the 
    payment as part of the original chained payment.
