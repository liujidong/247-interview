The JSON string exactly reflects:

. the data fields of an object
. the relationship bw the "parent" & "child" objects
1-1 parent_id in the "child" object or the child_id in the "parent" object
1-n "parent_id" in the "child" object or the association of "parent_id" & "child_id"
n-n the association of "parent_id" & "child_id"
. any association related id should not be in the JSON string because the association
should be created automatically
