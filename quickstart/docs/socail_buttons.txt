3. Login Architecture

http://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/login/login-architecture/

These login flows generate an access token, which you can use to make API calls on behalf of a user. 
Access token persistence and signing of API calls are handled automatically by the Client-side JavaScript SDK, 
iOS SDK and Android SDK. If you use the server-side login flow, you'll need to code persistence and signing for each of your apps.

6. Web Intents & Twitter Button

Web Intents provide popup-optimized flows for working with Tweets & Twitter Users: Tweet, Reply, Retweet, 
Favorite, and Follow. They make it possible for users to interact with Twitter content in the context of your site, 
without leaving the page or having to authorize a new app just for the interaction.

Web Intents automatically detect whether the end user is currently logged in to twitter.com and asks for login 
when necessary. If the user does not yet have a Twitter account, they'll have the opportunity to create one 
before realizing their original intention. No need to register an application or API key.


Web Intents don't require Javascript, but it makes it easier to pop them up most elegantly. 
We recommend rendering each Web Intent at 550px by 420px. If you use the provided pop-up Javascript, 
the heights will be adjusted for you. The pop-up will automatically close after the user has seen their 
intent to completion and users will be asked to confirm their action before it is executed.
