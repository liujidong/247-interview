** Getting Started: The Graph API

The Graph API is the primary way to get data in and out of Facebook's Open Graph. 
It's a low-level HTTP-based API that you can use to query data, post new stories, 
create check-ins or any of the other tasks that an app might need to do. 
Facebook's Open Graph allows you to define new objects and actions in a user's social graph, 
and the way that you create new instances of those actions and objects is via the Graph API.

The Open Graph itself is a graph in the computer science sense. It's not a simple table of data. 
It's a series of nodes which all connect to each other. 
This document is meant as an introduction about how to not only query nodes in the graph, 
but also how you can query connections between nodes in the Open Graph. 
Those connections are what let you post to a user's timeline, 
create location check-ins or work with a user's photos. 
So understanding when you need a node and when you need to create a connection is an important distinction.
